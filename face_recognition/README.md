# Face Recognition for Colab

A Python face recognition project for Google Colab that uses the face_recognition library would involve using the library to detect and recognize faces in video frames. The project involves training a model on a dataset of labeled face images, and then using the trained model to predict the identities of faces in new images or video frames. The project could also include features such as face detection, face alignment, and facial feature extraction. Additionally, the project could use Google Colab for running the code and training the model, as it offers free GPU and TPU resources.
