# Face Recognition Project using face_recognition Library

This project aims to build a face recognition model using the face_recognition library in Python. 

## Methodology
- The model is trained on a dataset of labeled face images
- The trained model is then used to predict the identities of faces in video frames
- Face detection, face alignment, and facial feature extraction are also included in the project.

## Tools
- Python
- face_recognition library
- Google Colab for running the code and training the model (it offers free GPU and TPU resources)

## Results
- The model should be able to accurately detect and recognize faces in video frames
- The project can also include features such as face detection, face alignment, and facial feature extraction.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of the face_recognition library in building a face recognition model. By using Google Colab, the model can be trained and run efficiently, thanks to the free GPU and TPU resources. The results of the model should be accurate face detection and recognition in images or video frames.
